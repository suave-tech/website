    title: Lava Photos taken at Hawaii <br>Volcanoes National Park.
    content: "
      <p>This collection of Hawaii photography is focused on the immense power of lava at the Volcanos National Park on the Big Island of Hawaii. One of the most truly mystical scenes I have ever had the pleasure of capturing. For this collection I wanted to showcase this beauty in my own artistic way, through fine art landscape photography. However still keep these scenes natural and true to what I witnessed on my journey. For that reason, these images have been only lightly processed. All of these images are single exposures, unless listed otherwise in the caption below the photo.</p>
